# MonkDefensiveHelper

**MonkDefensiveHelper** is a lightweight World of Warcraft addon that alerts you when you're in danger during raid encounters and should use one of your Monk's defensive abilities — like **Fortifying Brew** or **Dampen Harm**.

Ideal for Brewmaster, Mistweaver, and Windwalker Monks who want a visual reminder to stay alive during high-damage moments.
